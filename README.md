I Created an AI chatbot in C++ which involves integrating several components: natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, dialogue management, and a knowledge base for answering complete questions.
Key components: 
👉🏽Natural language processing( NLP): Use a library like TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or integrate external APIs for NLP tasks. Tokenization, lemmatization, and parsing of input sentences.
👉🏽Sentiment Analysis: Implement or use pre-trained sentiment analysis models to evaluate the user’s emotional state.
👉🏽Dialogue management: Use a state machine or a rule-based system, combined with context tracking, to manage dialogue flow.
👉🏽Question-Answering system: Use external APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT models) or a local knowledge graph/search system.
👉🏽Integration: Combine these components into a single architecture.
